Castellar-L'Oliveral is a samll suburban neighborhood of Valencia, on the other side of the new river bed of The TÃ¹ria and far from the city center. It still retains that agrarian old country town charm, and its growth is severily limited by the surrounding highways, water channels and marsh soil.

Taking advantage of an urban exercise from another subject - practical applications of the Valencia urban plans legislation -, this long exercise turned out a piece of cake, despite of involving several definitions of what kind of public services must be projected. Like a real full-urbanization: electricity, water supply, sanitation, telecommunications and so on.

Few colleagues are really interested in (so much work behind) and even fewer know how to do rightly, due to the overwhelming technical regulations.
