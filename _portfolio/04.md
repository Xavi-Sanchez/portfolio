#### Rehabilitation Project for an electric Warehouse

One of our clients wanted to expand the capacity of an old warehose, whose capacity is limited. The reason is that the current structure cannot cope with extreme heavy wire rolls of this day and age and fails partially, which has caused several frights to their workers. So, the client has to store outside and has voided spaces inside, something that harms the material.

The preliminary design of mine unfourtanetly required certain additional work in order to be properly adjusted: a structure calculation and a budget advance was done, and yes, almost an entire month of work.
