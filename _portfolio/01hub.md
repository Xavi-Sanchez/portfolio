Hubs are open-space standard coworking places equipped with a wide range of community services, which they are accesible via permits and quote payment. In this case, it was designed for a private company, whose main product is the building management and maintenance.

The plot and building remainings are the ancient "Davis-Macosa" company's workshop, which was an importan Valencia machining firm, known for their refined design of train depots and locomotives. Currently, the factory is located on the outskirts, but the site remains.

Compulsory work did not involve careful analysis, just matching what the teachers considered appropriate. YET in-depth research was clearly a sucess, on the grounds that the reality of Cruz Cubierta neighborhood in terms of business demand and other aspects differed from what was planned. Thus, it led to a program reduction and, as a natural consecuence, to be more manageable. That truly convinced the jury... although there was no more time for the 3Ds flourishes.

Among the planned strategies, one was somehow this bulding should be able to be divided (severed if has to be), by "Mitosis". Each part could be equally used for the main purposes, but the Idea would be that one building part will survive the other if happens a bussiness closure or a contract cancelation.

Nevertheless, it is still ONE building, there is an underground connection. That avoid having a barrier between them and, with enough width, it harbors a Conference Room.
