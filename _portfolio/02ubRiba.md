Riba-Roja del TÃ¹ria is a municipality located about 30 kms from Valencia, with all the usual problems which you could imagine in the case of inland municipalitiies near a metropolis. Like a chaotic urban planning, so much obsolete to these current times...

Under certain logical premises established by professors, including a great expert on the field, the solution to this exercise was to try to give some cohesion through interventions by smaller units, legalization of some "false" urbanizations and agrarian zones protections, like in Catalonia, called "agricultural parks".

All this, it could only based on a gread territorial analysis under a wide sidekick disciplines, not properly of an architect... unless you go on easy mode, which clearly I avoided.

On the one hand, there are several illegal developments of weekend-country houses. They grow everywhere, expanding on an undulating geography pleny of valleys, where townplanners and policemen do not usually inspect, so there still exist today by several legal tricks. Even these paths of houses do not have public light service. On the other hand, bad planning decisions have cause a polarization in 3 unconnected nuclei, one of them a logistic industrial zone which surrounds another smaller municipality, Loriguilla.

Normal exercise was about 10 pages, but mine was more than 30 pages, and it has won the Honour Roll of that Year.
